# BCT_Mini_Project

Problem Statement:
The healthcare industry faces significant challenges in securing sensitive patient data, which is often
stored in centralized systems vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, and tampering. This
project proposes SwasthyaChain, a blockchain-based decentralized application (dApp) that ensures
the integrity, security, and privacy of electronic health records (EHR). The solution leverages
blockchain technology and smart contracts to create an immutable, auditable, and secure platform
for managing health-related records, while addressing scalability issues using off-chain storage.


Objectives:
• Data Integrity: Ensure the immutability of medical records by storing cryptographic hashes
on a secure blockchain network.
• Patient Privacy: Protect patient identities and their medical information through
cryptographic encryption while enabling authorized access.
• Transparency: Provide real-time access logs and history of data modifications for auditing
purposes by patients and healthcare providers.
• Decentralized Data Storage: Distribute medical records across a blockchain network,
eliminating single points of failure.
• User-Friendly Interface: Create a simple, intuitive platform for healthcare providers and
patients to manage medical records seamlessly.
